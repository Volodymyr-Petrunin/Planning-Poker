# Planning-Poker

## üéØ Overview

**Planning Poker** is a collaborative game used in **Agile software development** to estimate the effort required for tasks or features. By playing this game, teams can reach a consensus on task complexity in a fun, efficient, and democratic way.

This project provides a **digital implementation** of the Planning Poker technique,
making it easy for Agile teams to estimate tasks remotely or in person.

The application supports localization in three languages: **English**, **Ukrainian**, and **Swedish**,
allowing teams from different regions to use it seamlessly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why This Project Is Important

Accurate **task estimation** is essential for successful project management in Agile environments. Poor estimates can lead to:

- **Missed deadlines**
- **Ineffective resource allocation**
- **Unclear project expectations**

**Planning Poker** solves these issues by:

- **Promoting collaboration**: Every team member contributes to the estimation process.
- **Reducing bias**: Estimates are made anonymously, preventing dominant voices from influencing others.
- **Improving accuracy**: A collective approach ensures more accurate estimations and early risk detection.
- **Making estimation fun**: The game-like format reduces stress, making the process more enjoyable for the team.
